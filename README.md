kantalupe
=========

An easy-to-use editor for creating model-based questionnaires. 

The idea is to create surveys/questionnaires based on a priorly created model.
The model, which is also editable in kantalupe, can be reused for creating surveys
as subsets of the model. The creation of surveys can be done manually using drag&drop, 
and/or automatically using the integrated JavaScript-Engine. Once created the surveys can
be saved (as XML) or exported to several different format, like LimeSurvey, QueXML etc.

Features from the user's point of view:

- Intuitive, lean and fast interface
- Model creation for multiple choice surveys with image support
- Manual Survey creation using Drag&Drop
- Automatic Survey generation using integrated JavaScript-Editor
- Export to LimeSurvey, QueXML, Android Resource XML, and more

Features from the coder's point of view:

- C++/Qt4, thus available for Linux, MacOS, Windows 
- QtCreator-Project
- Flexible Ressource Configuration (named XRS) used in conjunction with XSDe
- Fully integrated JavaScript-Editor with Syntax highlighting (and futurely with code completion)
- Plugin-Interface, currently for Exports only


Note: This project was initially started but also paused in 2011. 
Since then I had no time for further activities. I hope this may change in the near future.
