kantalupe
=========

An intuive desktop editor for creating model-based questionnaires. 

The idea is to create surveys/questionnaires based on a priorly created model.
The model, which is also editable in kantalupe, can be reused for build manually
surveys, i.e. subsets of the model. Additionally, a ECMA-Script-Engine allows
automatic creation of surveys.

Features from the user's point of view:

. Intuitive, lean and fast interface
. Model creation for multiple choice surveys with image support
. Manual Survey creation using Drag&Drop
. Automatic Survey generation using integrated JavaScript-Editor
. Export to LimeSurvey, QueXML, Android Resource XML, and more

Features from the coder's point of view:

. C++/Qt4, thus available for Linux, MacOS, Windows 
. QtCreator-Project
. Flexible Ressource Configuration (named XRS) used in conjunction with XSDe
. Fully integrated JavaScript-Editor with Syntax highlighting (and futurely with code completion)
. Plugin-Interface, currently for Exports only


Note: This project was initially started but also paused in 2011. 
Since then I had no time for further activities. I hope this may change in the near future.
